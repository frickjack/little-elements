# lw-pure-menu Custom Element

A custom element for automating some of the management around [pure menus](https://purecss.io/menus/)

[Test case](./index.html)

## Overview

Purecss provides a set of minimal CSS modules including a menu system.  This component automates some of the templating for the menu system, and integrates javascript handlers for drop-downs and menu selection events.

In its simplest mode of operation - the element just wraps DOM that the client inlines within the element.
